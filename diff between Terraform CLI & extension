What it is:
The actual Terraform program (terraform.exe on Windows) that performs the real work — creating, modifying, and destroying infrastructure.

🔹 What it does:
You use it in your terminal to run commands such as:

terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
terraform destroy


🔹 Purpose:

Reads .tf files.

Connects to cloud providers (Azure, AWS, etc.) through APIs.

Creates the resources defined in your code.

Maintains the Terraform state (terraform.tfstate).

🔹 Where it runs:
On your local machine (via PowerShell, CMD, or VS Code terminal) or in CI/CD pipelines (Azure DevOps, GitLab, etc.).

🔹 Example:
If you run:

terraform apply


➡️ The CLI calls Azure APIs and provisions resources like VNets, Storage Accounts, etc.

💻 2️⃣ Terraform VS Code Extension (HashiCorp Terraform)

🔹 What it is:
A VS Code plugin that helps you write Terraform code better — it’s a developer tool, not the engine.

🔹 What it does:

Provides syntax highlighting for .tf files.

Gives IntelliSense (auto-completion for resources, arguments, variables).

Shows linting/errors in real time.

Supports formatting (Shift + Alt + F).

Helps with code navigation (Go to Definition, Hover docs).

🔹 Purpose:
Improves your productivity and makes writing Terraform easier, but it cannot run Terraform commands by itself.

🔹 Where it runs:
Inside VS Code, as part of the editor.

🧩 In short
Feature	Terraform CLI	Terraform Extension
Type	Executable (binary program)	VS Code plugin
Purpose	Runs Terraform commands (init, plan, apply)	Helps write Terraform code
Executes Terraform code	✅ Yes	❌ No
Provides syntax highlighting	❌ No	✅ Yes
Needed for actual deployment	✅ Essential	Optional but helpful
Installed from	Terraform website	VS Code Marketplace
Runs in	Terminal / Shell	VS Code editor
💬 Analogy:

Think of it like this:

Terraform CLI = Engine of a car
VS Code Extension = Dashboard, steering wheel, and GPS that make driving easier

You need the CLI to actually move (apply infrastructure), while the extension just helps you write and visualize the code.
